The purpose of this problem is to help you understand and apply computational thinking to solve a difficult problem.


__1.__ 


This problem is known as the _chicken nuggets_ problem. It goes like this: you walk into Chick Fil-A with unlimited budget and appetite. You can purchase
nuggets in containers of 6, 9, and 20 nuggets. 

<br>

Write a Python script to tell you the ___highest___ number of nuggets that you ___cannot___ purchase! Re-read that just in case it went past you the first time!
The highest number that you cannot get. For example, you can get 15 by purchasing a box of 6 and a box of 9 nuggets. You can get 18 by purchasing 2 boxes of 9 or
3 boxes of 6. But with no combination of 6, 9, or 20 can you purchase 17 nuggets. What is the hightest number that you cannot get?!

<br>

This simple game will give you experience assembling different bits of Python programming to find the solution. It will also employ a very simple numerical
method called _brute force_ search. 

<br>

To correctly solve this problem, you must come up with a stopping rule. How do you know when you have found the solution? How can you put it into code? 

<br>

Happy hacking!!!
