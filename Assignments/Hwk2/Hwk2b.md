__1.__ A new formula for estimating the water evaporation from occupied swimming pools was proposed and analyzed in the journal _Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning Engineering_ (April 2013). The key components of the new formula are number of pool occupants, area of pool's water surface, and the density difference between room air temperature and the air at the pool's surface. Data were collected from a wide range of pools for which the evaporation level was known. The new formula was applied to each pool in the sample, yielding an estimated evaporation level. The absolute value of the deviation between the actual and estimated evaporation reported the following summary statistics for absolute percentage: $\bar{x} = 18, s = 20$. Assume that the sample contained $n = 15$ swimming pools. 

- __a.__ Estimate the true mean absolute deviation percentage for the new formula with a $90\%$ confidence interval.

- __b.__ The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) handbook also provides a formula for estimating pool evaporation. Suppose the ASHRAE mean absolute deviation percentage is $\mu = 34\%$. (This value was reported in the article). On average, is the new formula "better" than the ASHRAE formula? Explain.

__2.__ Molten salt is used in an electro-refiner to treat nuclear fuel waste. Eventually, the salt needs to be purified (for reuse) or disposed of. A promising method of purification involves oxidation. Such a method was investigated in _Chemical Engineering Research and Design_ (March. 2013). An important aspect of the purification process is the rising velocity of oxygen bubbles in the molten salt. An experiment was conducted in which oxygen was inserted (at a designated sparging rate) into molten salt and photographic images of the bubbles were taken. A random sample of 25 images yielded the data on bubble velocity (measured in meters per second) shown in the table. (_Note:_ These data are simulated based on information provided in the article.)

|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0.275 | 0.261 | 0.209 | 0.266 | 0.265 | 0.312 | 0.285 | 0.317 | 0.229 |
| 0.251 | 0.256 | 0.339 | 0.213 | 0.178 | 0.217 | 0.307 | 0.264 | 0.319 |
| 0.298 | 0.169 | 0.342 | 0.270 | 0.262 | 0.228 | 0.220 |       |       |

- __a.__ Find a $95\%$ confidence interval for the mean bubble rising velocity of the population. Interpret the result.

- __b.__ The researchers discovered that the mean bubble rising velocity is $\mu = 0.338$ when the sparging rate of oxygen is $3.33 \times 10^{-6}$. Do you know believe that the data in the table were generated at this sparging rate? Explain.

__3.__ Stock screeners are automated tools used by investment companies to help clients select a portfolio of stocks to invest in. The table below lists the annualized percentage return on investment (as compared to the S&P 500 Index) for 13 randomly selected stock screeners provided by the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII).

<br>

|     |      |      |      |      |     |      |     |     |      |      |      |     |
|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|------|-----|-----|------|------|------|-----|
| 9.0 | -0.1 | -1.6 | 14.6 | 16.0 | 7.7 | 19.9 | 9.8 | 3.2 | 24.8 | 17.6 | 10.7 | 9.1 |


<br>

- __a.__ Find a $90\%$ confidence interval for the average annualized percentage return on investment of stocks screeners provided by AAII. Interpret the result. 

- __b.__ Recall that a negative annualized return reflects a stock portfolio that performed worse than the S&P 500. On average, do the AAII stock screeners perform worse or better than the S&P 500? Explain. 

<br>

__4.__ A manufacturer of gunpowder has developed a new powder, which was tested in eight shells. The resulting muzzle velocities, in feet per second, were as follows:

<br>

|      |      |      |      |
|------|------|------|------|
| 3005 | 2925 | 2935 | 2965 |
| 2995 | 3005 | 2937 | 2905 |

<br>

Find a confidence interval for the true average velocity $\mu$ for shells of this type, with confidence coefficient $0.95$. Assume that muzzle velocities are approximately normally distributed. 

<br>

__5.__ Organic chemists often purify organic compounds by a method known as fractional crystalization. An experimenter wanted to prepare and purify $4.85$ grams (g) of aniline. Ten $4.85$-g specimens of aniline were prepared and purified to produce acetanilide. The following dry yields were obtained:

<br>

|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 3.85 | 3.88 | 3.90 | 3.62 | 3.72 | 3.80 | 3.85 | 3.36 | 4.01 | 3.82 |

<br>

Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for the mean number of grams of acetanilide that can be recovered from $4.85$ g of aniline.

<br>

__6.__ The Environmental Protection Agency has collected data on LC50 measurements (concentrations that kill $50\%$ of test animals) for certain chemicals likely to be found in freshwater rivers and lakes. For certain species of fish, the LC50 measurements (in parts per million) for DDT in twelve experiments were as follows:

<br>

|    |   |    |    |    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|----|---|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 5 | 21 | 19 | 10 | 5 | 8 | 2 | 7 | 2 | 4 | 9 |

<br>

Estimate the true mean LC50 for DDT, with confidence coefficient $0.90$. Assume that the LC50 measurements have an approximately normal distribution.
