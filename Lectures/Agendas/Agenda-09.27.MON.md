# __DATA 5600: Introduction to Regression and Machine Learning for Analytics__

0. Some thoughts on pedagogy

This weekend I read the following quotations from the book _The Elements of New Testament Greek_ by J.W. Wenham.

> _"The learning of a language is an enormous task. The secret of success is to gain a thorough grasp of the elements.
> If the elements are known, the rest will come bit by bit easily enough. But if the elements are not known, the student will
> flounder and make no progress. The student should be protected from all avoidable toil which does not directly further this end."_ 

And this one:

> _"I shall consider that I have done the student a great service if I have succeeded in robbing the -$\mu\iota$ verbs of their terror."_ 

This struck a chord with me because I believe this same sentiment applies to learning the elements of probability theory as the foundation
of data science and machine learning. I will similarly declare victory when I have robbed the concept of the sampling distribution of its terror. 
A student who has mastered the fundamental elements of statistical reasoning can go on and learn the rest bit by bit and achieve great success. A
student who does not will flounder. This is why I labor so diligently to teach these concepts.
