___NB:___ These defintions are taken from many sources. This is for teaching purposes only as a quick and convenient reference. These notes are not intended for distribution.

__Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):__

__Probability Density:__ See _probability distribution_.

__Probability Density Function (PDF):__ See _probability distribution_.

__Probability Distribution:__ For a discrete random variable, a mathematical formula that gives the probability of each value of the variable. See, for example, 
			  _binomial distribution_ and _Poisson distribution_. For a continuous random variable, a curve described by a mathematical formula which specifies,
			  by way of areas under the curve, the probability that the variable falls within a particular interval. Examples include the _normal distribution_ and
			  the _exponential distribution_. In both cases the term _probability density_ may also be used. (A distinction is sometimes made between 'density' and 
			  'distribution', when the latter is reserved for the probability that the random variable falls below some value. In this glossary, however, the latter
			  will be termed the _cumulative probability distribution_ and probability distribution and probability density used synonymously.)
